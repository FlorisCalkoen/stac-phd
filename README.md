# Living by the Coast as Sea-level Rise is Accelerating - STAC Catalog

This repository contains a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) for coastal datasets
produced or cataloged during the PhD research of F.R. Calkoen (TU Delft / Deltares). 
Thecatalog includes data on coastal classification, coastal exposure, and other 
relatedcharacteristics. Following the conclusion of the CoCliCo project in September 
2025, accessing the datasets now requires an SAS token, which is available from 
Deltares upon reasonablerequest. Alternatively, the datasets can be downloaded from 
Zenodo repositories. Please see associated publications for details.
